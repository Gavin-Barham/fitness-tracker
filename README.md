# pern-ts-fitness-tracker
 A fitness tracker project for learning and gaining experience with the PERN stack (PostgreSQL database engine, Express framework, React library, Node runtime environment) with TS (typescript) as the main programming language accross all tools, frameworks, and libraries. As well as a heavy focus on system design for a larger mutipage application. Another focus of this project was to gain more experience with UI mockups with a mobile first approach while still considering desktop as a secondary priority.
